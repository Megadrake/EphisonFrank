I wanted to start this out with the question I believe needs answered first, the answer I first heard to great effect in Neil Gaiman’s afterword for American Gods, a book written by a British man about the mythical soul of America: how dare I?

I start with this because I believe any undertaking begun in earnest should start with a little fear and trembling: fear that it may fail somehow or succeed in any capacity, that there are consequences at all. I also hope to answer this question for your sake. If you’ve been on the internet for any appreciable time, you have encountered far too many people who haven’t asked this question before speaking their minds. I’ve been among them plenty of times! What makes what I’m doing here something more than just screaming out in the void? Who am I that I’m more than that?

I could say that I’m a writer, that I have written quite a bit in my time, but I don’t feel I’ve written nearly as much as I should have. I journaled intensely in my teenage years, wrote a novel of passion that I’m still trying to break today, only to peter off in wordcount when trying to formalize these practices in an English degree. The degree, I’m still unclear on what that’s done for me rather than show my capacity for stubbornness.

And I couldn’t in good faith say I was particularly good at writing. I never got special attention in classes. In the creative classes there was always someone more passionate than me, more electric, and in the technical there was always someone more intense about the rubric. 

I remember, in fact, one time I was in a short story writer’s workshop type class, and I never looked at the rubric once. I just wrote whatever came to my mind. One student even pointed out that I failed to focus on a single character as per the rubric’s instructions, and I generally thought walking away with a B at the cost of doing what I wanted was a fair enough trade. It was a story I was proud of and plan on returning to, even though that was the worst workshop of my life. Get your W’s where you can, I guess. If no one else is going to give you one, look around a bit where the offering hands aren’t.

But I could never identify with the students that clenched their fists claiming the class “just didn’t get it” when I didn’t produce something satisfactory. I remember a student saying as much when he wrote a story about the fury of infidelity without the slightest consistency in scene. One moment he was in a pub, the other a disco. I thought for a second it was a bowling alley for this change, since that’s the only place I know that accomplishes this transition with any regularity. It did add a surreal element that destabilized the reader as the perspective character was also destabilized, but he was honest enough to say he didn’t catch it in the revision. He also felt bad from his workshop and mumbled the initial phrase in a clenched resolution to himself. I can’t agree with that.

I think so many people engage in the medium they’ve found themselves only because it’s the medium they’ve found themselves in. Their reasons are entirely incidental: people want respect, legitimacy, or a good lifestyle. Since their talent* is in this thing, they’ll find what they’re looking for in this thing. This seems a miserable existence to me. 

This whole writing thing, I just think it’s neat. Hopefully it’s entertaining. Hopefully you enjoy what I say and how I say it.

Unfortunately, I do have an ulterior motive, though a small one. There’s a point in a class on any subject where you may have asked what the point of it was. Maybe the teacher didn’t communicate enthusiasm about the subject or maybe you weren’t in a receptive position at the time. My failing in this was sports, not seeing the benefit until I was already out of the mix. My hope is that I can show you the importance of reading, watching TV and film, and doing so deeply and well. Not just to see a film, and not just to nitpick what parts you might not have liked, but to see stories in the same light you see the people who make them, as living, nuanced creatures who live somewhere outside of your own expectations.

This is the benefit of storytelling. We can look at the things humans built and see the humanity in them from a safe and distant environment real people seldom give us. It’s a training ground. At its best, it can build us up to something greater than we could have been on our own. It can train us to interact with real people more deeply and compassionately than we could have without these stories. It can only do that if we let it though, and more than allow it to move in us, we have to learn to see.

I think about guys looking at car engines. When I see an engine, I have only the vague idea of where to put certain fluids, and only then because of friendly labeling. To a car guy, though, it’s all laid bare. He can see more of the engine than I ever could, and thus his opinions on one engine or another have a stronger basis for defense. Stories can largely be the same. Each has these moving parts that could be mystifying or, at worst, something only used to take you from one place to the next. It only becomes more than that when someone else walks you through it.

The thing that mystifies me is that car guys enjoy engines. Through their knowledge comes joy and satisfaction. If we can’t have that reaction with what we know then I believe we’re not learning right. The world’s so much more beautiful along the way, and while I can’t say I’m the most equipped for the job, I’d like to at least show you how I’ve learned to point at things and go “woooooooooow.” I hope the product of my amazement at media can be of some use to you, and in my wildest fantasies, I also hope they can teach you to do the same.

That’s how I dare. Please, kindly dare with me as we proceed.
